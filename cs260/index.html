            <h2>CS 260 Course Description</h2> 
                <p>Covers general-purpose data structures and algorithms, software engineering of these structures, and the application of these engineering concepts to real world problems. Topics covered complexity analysis and operations of  stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, sets, maps, and graphs. Python OOP and unit testing.</p>
            <h2>CS 260 Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Describe the properties, interfaces, and behaviors of basic abstract data types, such as collection, bag, indexed collection, sorted collection, stack, and queue</li>
                  <li>Read an algorithm or program code segment that contains iterative constructs and analyze the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm or code segment.</li>
                  <li>State the asymptotic time complexity of the fundamental operations associated with a variety of data structures, such as vector, linked list, tree, and heap.</li>
                  <li>Recall the space utilization of common data structures in terms of the long-term storage needed to maintain the structure, as well as the short-term memory requirements of fundamental operations, such as sorting</li>
                  <li>Design and implement general-purpose, reusable data structures that implement one or more abstractions.</li>
                  <li>Compare and contrast the operation of common data structures (such as linear structures, priority queues, tree structures, hash tables, maps, and graphs) in terms of time complexity, space utilization, and the abstract data types they implement.</li>
                  <li>Gather, comprehend, and communicate scientific and technical information in order to explore ideas, models and solutions and generate further questions</li>
                  <li>Apply scientific and technical models of inquiry, individually, and collaboratively, to critically evaluate existing or alternative explanations, solve problems, and make evidence-based decisions in an ethical manner</li>
                  <li>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of scientific studies and critically examine the influence of scientific and technical knowledge on human society and the environment.</li>
                </ul>
