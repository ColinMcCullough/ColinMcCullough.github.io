            <p>The article “Software Is Hard” by Kyle Wilson discusses the various complications and limitations of developing software that has prevented projects from being produces with a high degree of consistency, predictability or reliability. The question is raised “why can't we build software the same way we build bridges.”</p>
            <p>Wilson brings up the example of Chandler, an open source project written about in the book “Dreaming in Code,” by Rosenburg. Chandler did not have the typical tight time constraints of a for profit business, virtually no budget limitations, and some of the brightest software engineers working on the project yet it dragged on for years and never ended up producing the revolutionary project they set out to create. Having tight constraints and a clear product roadmap have proven to be critical in producing successful software. Chandler lacked constraints which lead to constant changes and debates for the vision of the product. These changes delayed product releases and required massive infrastructure updates which complicated the product further. Chandler also attempted to build simultaneous cross platform development which is incredibly time consuming. Python, Chandlers chosen programming language was not commonly used among experienced programmers at the time which made it difficult to find the number of qualified programmers needed. Finally, peer-to-peer architecture complicated communication and security requirements causing even more delays. </p>
            <p>Wilson then examines how difficult it is to determine the cost, complexity and amount of time it will take to build a software product. With gaming software, it’s typically determined to be complete when “the marginal cost of each additional bug fixed or feature added exceeds the marginal utility in additional sales.” Many have tried to use lines of code from similar past projects to determine the time it will take to create a similar program. The problem with this method is that every great new piece of software does something new and has unique requirements, features and architecture. Due to the complexity, it’s impossible to forecast all the potential issues that will inevitably arise. It’s widely accepted among programmers that it is impossible to determine how much time was invested in a program simply based on lines of code. After a half a century of software development there are still only 2 very effective methods available for estimating software development time. The Ninety-Ninety Rule which states "The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. The "Hofstadter's Law," which says, “it always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.”</p>
