            <p>This article depicts the emerging need for new and better business communication and collaboration methods specifically for fast paced, high growth companies running cloud software in industries with high competition. Devops began as a set of best practices to address bottle necks within organizations that slowed down innovation, created silos across departments with tedious slow processes for testing and releasing software. These days Devops is being used more and more as a way for businesses to continually improve and innovate software during this age where so many industries are being disrupted and the motto change or die is more common than ever. Some of the key elements to Devops that IBM has defined are continuous innovation, fast time-to-market releases, exceptional user experience, fast time-to-feedback and continuous delivery. This elements promote a cycle of continuous improvement by learning and changing through a fast feedback loop.</p>
            <p>IBM has defined a number of key aspects of how Devops can be implemented successfully within an organization. First, it’s important for Devops to consider the end to end software cycle to ensure information is not lost and can be used for continuous improvement. Devops is especially valuable with cloud based software. Continuous delivery is the ultimate goal for organizations applying a DevOps approach. IBM has explained Devops simple as “essential enterprise capability for the continuous delivery of software-driven innovation that enables organizations to seize market opportunities and reduce time to customer feedback.”</p>
            <p>Devops aims to help various departments and individuals across organizations achieve their respective goals by closer integration. An executive may be most concerned with delivering innovation and transformation with faster software releases that meet the customer demands. Development management may be focused primarily on improving operational metrics around cost, risk, quality, productivity and speed in the development cycle. DevOps practitioners want to work on great applications, focus on delivering value, eliminating waste, auto-mating grunt work, and making release party weekends a thing of the past. All of these goals should be considered when developing a Devops strategy.</p>
          <h2>Transformation Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>To speed continuous innovation of ideas by enabling collaborative development and testing across the value chain.</li>
              <li>To enable continuous delivery of these innovations by automating software delivery processes and eliminating waste—while still helping to address regulatory concerns.</li>
              <li>To provide a feedback loop for continuous learning from customers by monitoring and optimizing software driven innovation.</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>IT Efficiency Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>To correct the present misalignment of people and goals by fostering closer links between developers, operations and the business.</li>
              <li>To accelerate and remove error from the delivery of changes by introducing automation throughout the development cycle</li>
              <li>To improve insight into the real value of applications by using customer feedback to drive optimization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Businesses that successfully utilize Devops tend to adopt a series of methodologies that promote the goals of Devops. Design thinking is important for ensuring an exceptions user experience. Lean startup focuses on testing and proving an idea prior to investing resources into it. Agile is focused on feedback loops to continuously improve based on internal and external customer’s experiences. Cloud operations enable fast and flexible development environments. Continuous security is essential to keep a product from becoming vulnerable. Delivery automation by enabling continuous delivery for different departments in a business. Application monitoring helps to catch bugs in live and test environments. User analytics is crucial to providing a great customer experience by seeing how users are interacting with software. IB has also identified a six phase life cycle for how to apply Devops in an organization. Think, code, deliver, run, manage and learn. This is to be used as a cycle for continuous improvement that never ends.</p>
