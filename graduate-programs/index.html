              <p>I grew up in Eugene and absolutely love living in Oregon. The University of Oregon is considered to be one of the top schools in the state so its an obvious option for myself. Software engineering is the current computer science degree path I am most seriously considering and the UO has an undergrad program specifically tailored for it. This degree would give me the skill set necessary to hopefully advance into the Engineering department at my current workplace as a Junior Software Engineer. UO also has a pretty amazing graduate program designing graphics and animation software that sounds incredibly interesting.</p>

              <p>Being able to complete my undergrad while living in Bend at OSU Cascades makes the program incredibly desirable to me. I have heard nothing but great things about the Web and Mobile Software Development program Yong is running. I have some friends who are currently enrolled in the program in Bend as Juniors and Seniors and have already been successful finding work in the industry within Bend. I am really passionate about coming up with ideas to improve efficiency in all aspects of my life. What I find most fascinating about developing mobile apps is it gives you the freedom to come up with a problem or an inefficiency you may be experiencing and develop a solution that humans could not solve without software.</p>

          <h2>Current Life Deciding Factors</h2>
            <h3>Location</h3>
              <p>The location of where I live will play a large role in my decision of which 4 year University I choose to go to. I really want to stay in Oregon being that my family, friends and job are all in Oregon.</p>
              <h3>Employer</h3>
              <p>I am currently employed at G5 Search Marketing as a Senior SEO Analyst which is giving me some experience in coding, helping to pay my tuition, and offering me a potential career path in software engineering after completing a degree in computer science. By staying in Oregon I will be able to keep my current position that is enabling me to develop my coding skill set in school and apply it at work building internal tools.</p>
