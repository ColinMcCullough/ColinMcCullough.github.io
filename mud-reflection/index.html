          <p>This article provided a new perspective on the importance of one’s business model in the development of software. People build messy programs not always intentionally but because they can provide a quick and dirty solution. Not every business or startup has the means or time to build a highly architecturally sound piece of software and providing an entry level product quickly to the market may be the only option. In theory with unlimited time, resources and money one could take their time to ensure all bugs are solved prior to a release however this is fairly unrealistic in most businesses that employ programmers. It is interesting to consider the conflicting perspectives, goals and initiatives that each department or individual in a business may have. Typically revenue comes first which cannot be generated without a product leading to releases that are “balls of mud” at times. Although it’s not ideal to build a tangled web of code or “ball of mud”, one of the benefits described is that it enables a business to have users testing and unveiling issues which need to be fixed quickly. Alternatively, a long drawn out expensive project may not realize issues until the software is at a point which requires a much more time consuming effort to fix bugs due to its complexity. Ultimately “Balls of Mud” do serve a purpose which is why they likely will not be going away any time soon. The author aims to describe three solutions for what programmers can do when encountering a “Big Ball of Mud. Maintain and evolve, throw it out and start over, or surrender to the chaos and enjoy it. I appreciated the realistic approach this article took to why software is not created without flaws and some of the advantages of operating this way.</p>
